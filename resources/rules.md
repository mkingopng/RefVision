# Powerlifts & Rules of Performance

## Item 4.1 Squat
4.1.1 The lifter shall face the front of the platform. The bar shall be held
horizontally across the shoulders, not more than 3cm below the posterior
deltoids. The hands shall be gripping the bar and may be positioned
anywhere inside or in contact with the inner surface of the sleeves of
the bar. The hands cannot be in contact with the plates at any time. A
thumbless grip is permitted.

4.1.2 Not more than five and not less than three spotters/loaders shall be on
the platform at any time (this does not include the monolift gate operator).
A lifter may not use their own personal back spotter during the set-up or
performance of the lift. However, a lifter can request that the back spotter
lines them up under the bar.

4.1.3 The lifter may enlist the help of the spotter/loaders in removing the bar
from the racks, however, once the bar has cleared the racks, the spotter/
loaders shall not assist the lifter further in setting up.

4.1.4 For the Raw division, after removing the bar from the squat racks, the lifter
must move backwards by taking one or more steps to establish the proper
starting position. The lifter shall assume an upright position (a slight lean
forward is permitted) with the knees locked.

4.1.5 For the Wraps, Single-Ply and Multi-Ply divisions, after removing the bar
from the monolift, the lifter may elect to walk backwards or to move their
feet outwards or inwards to establish their starting position. The lifter may
also elect to keep their feet set in the position they unrack in. The lifter
shall assume an upright position (a slight lean forward is permitted) with
the knees locked.

4.1.6 The lifter shall wait in this position for the Head Referee’s signal. The
signal shall be given as soon as the lifter is motionless with knees locked
and the bar properly positioned. The Head Referee’s signal shall consist
of a downward movement of the arm and the audible command “SQUAT”.
For reasons of safety, the lifter will be requested to “REPLACE” the bar,
together with a backward motion of the arm, if after five seconds they are
not in the correct position to begin the lift.

4.1.7 Upon receiving the Head Referee’s signal, the lifter must bend the knees
and lower the body until the top surface of the legs at the hip joint is lower
than the top of the knees. Only one decent attempt is allowed. The attempt
is deemed to have commenced when the lifter unlocks their knees.

4.1.8 The lifter must stand back up to an upright position with the knees locked,
without double-bouncing at the bottom of the squat or any downward
movement of the bar during the ascent. When the lifter is motionless, the
Head Referee will give the signal to rack the bar.

4.1.9 The signal to replace the bar will consist of a backward motion of the
arm and the audible command “RACK”. The lifter must then make a true
attempt to return the bar to the racks.

## Item 4.2 Causes for Disqualification of a Squat:
4.2.1 Failure to observe the Head Referee’s signals at the commencement or
completion of a lift.

4.2.2 Double-bouncing or more than one descending or ascending motion
throughout the lift. The only exception to this is that of a lifter setting
their breath before commencing the descent. This inadvertent upward/
downward movement of the bar shall not be reason to disqualify the lift.

4.2.3 Failure to assume an upright position with the knees locked at the
commencement and completion of the lift.

4.2.4 Any shifting of the feet laterally, backwards or forwards, between the Head
Referee’s signals.

4.2.5 Failure to bend the knees and lower the body until the top surface of the
legs at the hip joint is lower than the top of the knees.

4.2.6 Contact with the bar by the spotter/loaders between the Head Referee’s
signals.

4.2.7 Contact of elbows or upper arms with the legs, slight contact is permitted
if there is no supporting that might aid the lifter.

4.2.8 Failure to make a true attempt to return the bar to the racks upon receiving
the “RACK” command.

4.2.9 Any intentional dropping or dumping of the bar, or action that jeopardizes
the safety of any personnel, will be deemed a serious infraction and may,
at the discretion of the meet director in consultation with the referees,
result in immediate disqualification from the competition or forfeiture of
any subsequent attempts on the lift where the infraction occurs. There
must be no fault of the spotters when imposing this discretion.

4.2.10 Failure to comply with any of the requirements outlined under Rules of
Performance for the squat.

4.2.11 Failing to receive the “SQUAT” command before the one-minute clock
expires.

4.2.12 Contact between the bar and the bar-rest supports during the lift that can
be deemed to assist the lifter. However, unintentional contact that did not
assist the lifter is not a reason to turn down the lift.

4.2.13 If a lifter steps in any direction after the completion of the lift, and after
the “RACK” command has been given, it is not a reason to red light the lift
unless the lifter has lost control and is unable to make a true attempt to
rerack the weight.

## Item 4.3 Bench Press:

4.3.1 The head of the bench must be placed on the platform facing the Head
Referee.

4.3.2 The lifter must lie on their back with their shoulders and buttocks in
contact with the flat bench surface. This position must be maintained
throughout the lift. The head may remain flat or rise during the lift. Any
part or all of the soles of the lifter’s shoes must be in contact with the
platform during the lift. The feet may move up and down during the lift and
come into contact with each other, as long as they do not come in contact
with the equipment.

4.3.3 The hands must grip the bar with all of the fingers and thumbs wrapped
around the bar. A thumbless grip is not permitted. The spacing of the
hands may not exceed 81cm, measured between the forefingers. The
bar shall have circumferential machine markings or tape to indicate
the maximum grip allowance. If a lifter must use an offset or unequal
grip, whereby one hand is placed outside the marking, it is the lifter’s
responsibility to explain to the head referee and allow inspection of
the intended grip prior to making the attempt. The maximum distance
between the lifters index fingers using an offset grip may never exceed
81cm.

4.3.4 To achieve firm footing the lifter may use flat surfaced plates or blocks to
build up the surface of the platform, not exceeding 30cm in total height, or
50cm x 50cm in length/width.

4.3.5 Not more than four, and not less than two spotter/loaders shall assist the
lifter on the platform. The lifter may enlist the help of the spotter/loaders in
removing the bar from the racks.

4.3.6 The lifter may enlist a personal spotter to assist in removing the bar from
the racks. If a centre spotter is used, they must move off the platform
and to one side after the handoff prior to the commencement of the lift.
For safety reasons they will be allowed to stay in close proximity (but not
blocking the referees view) for any emergencies.

4.3.7 After removing the bar from the racks or receiving it from the spotter/
loaders, the lifter shall show full lock-out of both elbows, along with
complete control prior to the “START” command being given.

4.3.8 For reasons of safety, the lifter will be requested to “REPLACE” the bar,
together with a backward motion of the arm, if after five seconds they are
not in the correct position to begin the lift.

4.3.9 After receiving the “START” command, the lifter must lower the bar and
touch the chest/abdominal area. At no time may the bar come in contact
with the lifter’s belt.

4.3.10 Once the bar is motionless on the chest/abdominal area, the audible
command “PRESS” will be given. The bar must be pressed upwards
until the elbows are fully locked. Any pronounced or exaggerated uneven
lockout of the bar is not allowed.

4.3.11 Note: If a lifter has any physical abnormality, handicap or incapacity that
prevents them from extending their arm or arms with elbows fully locked,
they must inform and show physical, visual proof to the Head Referee prior
to the start of their lift.

4.3.12 When the bar is held motionless at arm’s length, with the elbows fully
locked, the audible command “RACK” shall be given. The spotter/loaders
may assist the lifter in returning the bar to the rack.

## Item 4.4 Causes for Disqualification of a Bench Press

4.4.1 Failure to observe any of the Head Referee’s signals for the lift.

4.4.2 Any change in the elected lifting position after the “START” command
has been given (with the exception of the head) including any raising
movement of the shoulders or buttocks from their original points of
contact with the bench, or lateral movement of the hands on the bar.
Note: If the buttocks are not in contact with the bench when the “START”
command is given, and the lifter lowers them to the bench while the arms
are still locked out, this will not be cause for disqualification of the lift.

4.4.3 Any downward movement of the bar after the “PRESS” command has
been given.

4.4.4 Failure to press the bar to full extension of the arms at the completion of
the lift.

4.4.5 Intentional contact with the bar by spotter/loaders between the Head
Referee’s signals.

4.4.6 Any contact of the lifter’s feet with the bench or its supports. Movement
of the feet is permitted as long as part of the soles of both shoes remain in
contact with the floor at all times.

4.4.7 Contact between the bar and the bar-rest supports during the lift that can
be deemed to assist the lifter. However, unintentional contact that did not
assist the lifter is not a reason to turn down the lift.

4.4.8 The bar coming into contact with the lifting belt.

4.4.9 Failure to comply with any of the requirements outlined under Rules of
Performance for the bench.

4.4.10 Failing to receive the “START” command before the one-minute clock
expires.

4.4.11 Receiving assistance on the platform (e.g. adjusting the shirt, belt, wraps,
body position, etc.) from any person before or during the performance of
the lift.

4.4.12 The bar coming into contact with the safety arms of the bench press.

## Item 4.5 Deadlift

4.5.1 The lifter shall face the front of the platform.

4.5.2 The lifter has one attempt to complete the lift. Any rising of the bar that
can be deemed a deliberate attempt will be counted as an attempt.

4.5.3 The bar must be laid horizontally in front of the lifter’s feet, gripped with an
optional grip in both hands. The lifter can start the lift at any time before
the one-minute clock expires. Once started, it must be lifted without any
downward movement until the lifter is standing erect, with the knees and
shoulders locked out. If the bar settles as the lifter’s shoulders come back
(slight downward motion), this should not be a reason to disqualify the lift.

4.5.4 The Head Referee’s signal shall consist of a downward movement of the
arm and the audible command “DOWN”. The signal will not be given until
the bar is held motionless and the lifter is in the finished position.

4.5.5 The lifter will return the bar to the platform with both hands on the bar and
under control.

## Item 4.6 Causes for Disqualification of a Deadlift

4.6.1 Any downward movement of the bar before it reaches the final position
before the “DOWN” command is given.

4.6.2 Failure to stand erect with the knees and shoulders in a locked position.

4.6.3 Supporting the bar on the thighs during the performance of the lift. If the
bar edges up the thigh but cannot be deemed as being supported by the
thighs, this is not a cause for disqualification of the lift.

4.6.4 Stepping backward or forward, or lateral movement of the foot, before
the “DOWN” command is given. Rocking the foot between ball and heel
is permitted. Foot movement after the “DOWN” command is permitted
for safety reasons, however, if the foot movement is deemed as a lack of
control, such as a stumble, the lift will be disqualified.
Lowering the bar before receiving the Head Referee’s signal.

4.6.5 Lowering the bar before receiving the Head Referee’s signal.

4.6.6 Allowing the bar to return to the platform without maintaining control of
both hands on the bar, i.e. releasing the bar from the hands before the
plates contact the platform.

4.6.7 Failure to comply with any of the requirements outlined under Rules of
Performance for the deadlift.

4.6.8 Failing to begin the lift prior to the one-minute time clock expiring. The
lift will officially begin when the lifter makes a determined or deliberate
attempt to raise the bar.

4.6.9 Shaking of the body under maximum exertion during the deadlift is not
necessarily a cause for disqualification.
