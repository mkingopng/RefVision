# 2. Problem Statement (3 minutes)
- Contentious Decisions: Referee judgments on "Good" lifts often lead to disputes.
- Lack of Appeals: No effective method exists for athletes to appeal decisions.
- Rising Stakes: Increased prize money and record implications heighten tensions.
- Sport Integrity at Risk: Disputes can detract from the sport's reputation and viewer experience.
- Example: [Embed Video Clip of a Controversial Lift Decision]

# 3. Proposed Solution: RefVision VAR (3 minutes)
- Video Referee Integration: Implement a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system tailored for powerlifting.
- Supplementary Role: Enhances human referees with impartial video analysis.
- Limited Appeals: Each lifter gets one VAR appeal per meet to ensure tactical use and prevent delays.
- Enhanced Engagement: Adds drama and transparency, making competitions more exciting for audiences.
- Diagram: Integration of RefVision VAR with Traditional Refereeing

# Why Serverless Architecture?
- Cost Efficiency: Pay-as-you-go model ideal for applications with variable usage.
- Scalability: Automatically handles varying loads without manual intervention.
- Maintenance: Reduced overhead in managing infrastructure.

## Challenges:
- GPU Support: Essential for efficient CV model inference; limited in traditional serverless.
- No Native GPU Serverless: AWS lacks a true serverless GPU solution for CV applications.

## Solution:
- Hybrid Approach: Combine AWS SageMaker endpoints with ECS Fargate for scale-to-zero GPU support.
- Icon-based Representation of Benefits and Challenges

# Deep Dive into Serverless Components (18 minutes)
[Each component can have 2-3 slides: Overview, Configuration, Best Practices/Challenges]

---
# 4.1. Video Ingestion and Preprocessing (2 minutes)
Components:
- Local Camera: Captures live video feed.
- AWS Kinesis Video Streams: Streams video to S3 in real-time.
- S3 Buckets:
  - Raw Video Storage: raw videos stored as .mp4
  - Preprocessed Storage: Processed frames and chunks.
- DynamoDB: Stores metadata and triggers preprocessing.
- AWS Lambda: Executes preprocessing tasks on incoming video.

## Workflow:
- Capture & Stream: Local cameras send live feed to Kinesis Video Streams.
- Storage: Video is segmented and stored in the Raw S3 Bucket.
- Metadata Recording: DynamoDB logs video segment details.
- Preprocessing: Lambda functions extract and transform frames, saving to Preprocessed S3 Bucket.
- Metadata Update: DynamoDB records locations of preprocessed frames.
