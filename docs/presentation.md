2. **Use Consistent Visual Themes**:
   - Maintain a consistent color scheme and iconography for AWS services to help the audience quickly identify components in diagrams.

3. **Minimize Redundancy**:
   - Ensure that information about each service is presented once, avoiding repetition across slides. For example, Step Functions are detailed both in the deep dive and the architecture walkthrough; ensure these sections complement rather than duplicate each other.

4. **Emphasize Integration Points**:
   - Highlight how services interact, particularly how Step Functions coordinate tasks across Lambda, SageMaker, ECS Fargate, Bedrock, and DynamoDB. Use arrows or connecting lines in diagrams to show these relationships clearly.

5. **Engage with Examples and Analogies**:
   - Use analogies to explain complex serverless concepts. For example, liken Step Functions to a project manager overseeing each task in a competition.

6. **Rehearse Timing and Transitions**:
   - Practice transitioning smoothly between sections to maintain a steady pace. Allocate time dynamically based on the complexity of each topic.

7. **Highlight Unique Selling Points (USPs)**:
   - Throughout the presentation, subtly reinforce what makes RefVision unique, such as its novel use of serverless architecture for live video processing in sports.

8. **Interactive Elements**:
   - If feasible, include interactive elements like live demonstrations of how Step Functions trigger workflows or real-time monitoring dashboards.
